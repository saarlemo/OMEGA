%% MATLAB/Octave code for CBCT custom algorithm reconstruction for Planmeca data
% This example contains a simplified example for custom algorithm
% reconstruction using Planmeca CBCT data. Currently the support for some
% of the additional features is limited. The default configuration uses
% CGLS without multi-resolution reconstruction, but PDHG with
% multi-resolution is included below CGLS, but has been commented. PDHG
% should also work without multi-resolution reconstruction.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPLEMENTATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Reconstruction implementation used
% 1 = Reconstructions in MATLAB (projector in a MEX-file), uses matrices.
% (Slow and memory intensive)
% 2 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL/CUDA (Recommended)
% (Requires ArrayFire).
% 3 = Multi-GPU/device matrix-free OpenCL (OSEM & MLEM only).
% 4 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenMP (CPU, parallel), standard C++
% 5 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL (parallel)
% See the docs for more information:

% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and
% their respective devices with implementations 3 or 5.

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% OpenCL/CUDA device used
% NOTE: Use ArrayFire_OpenCL_device_info() to determine the device numbers
% with implementation 2.
% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and
% their respective devices with implementations 3 or 5.
% NOTE: The device numbers might be different between implementation 2 and

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROJECTOR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Type of projector to use for the geometric matrix
% 1 = Improved/accelerated Siddon's algorithm
% 2 = Orthogonal distance based ray tracer
% 3 = Volume of intersection based ray tracer
% 4 = Interpolation-based projector
% 5 = Branchless distance-driven projector
% NOTE: You can mix and match most of the projectors. I.e. 41 will use
% interpolation-based projector for forward projection while improved
% Siddon is used for backprojection.
% NOTE 2: The below additional options apply also in hybrid cases as long
% as the other projector is the corresponding projector.
% See the doc for more information:
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/selectingprojector.html
options.projector_type = 4;

%%% Use mask
% The mask needs to be a binary mask (uint8 or logical) where 1 means that
% the pixel is included while 0 means it is skipped. Separate masks can be
% used for both forward and backward projection and either one or both can
% be utilized at the same time. E.g. if only backprojection mask is input,
% then only the voxels which have 1 in the mask are reconstructed.
% The mask can be either a 2D image that is applied identically to each slice
% or a 3D mask that is applied as-is
% Forward projection mask
% If nonempty, the mask will be applied. If empty, or completely omitted, no
% mask will be considered.
% options.maskFP = true(options.nRowsD,options.nColsD);
% Backprojection mask
% If nonempty, the mask will be applied. If empty, or completely omitted, no
% mask will be considered.
% Create a circle that fills the FOV:
% [columnsInImage, rowsInImage] = meshgrid(1:options.Nx, 1:options.Ny);
% centerX = options.Nx/2;
% centerY = options.Ny/2;
% radius = options.Nx/2;
% options.maskBP = uint8((rowsInImage - centerY).^2 ...
%     + (columnsInImage - centerX).^2 <= radius.^2);

%%% Interpolation length (projector type = 4 only)
% This specifies the length after which the interpolation takes place. This
% value will be multiplied by the voxel size which means that 1 is
% the interpolation length corresponding to a single voxel (transaxial)
% length. Larger values lead to faster computation but at the cost of
% accuracy. Recommended values are between [0.5 1].
