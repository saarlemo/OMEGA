%% MATLAB codes for CBCT reconstruction for the MCGPU data
% This example contains a simplified example for MCGPU CBCT data.
% Simplified refers to less number of selectable options. You can always
% add other options manually. This example uses PDHG with subsets and
% filtering. Other algorithms that have been left here are PKMA and PDDY.
% Regularization includes TV, NLM, RDP, GGMRF and the non-local variations.
% You can manually add any of the built-in priors if desired. You can
% simply run this file and select the desired measurement data and use the
% default parameters or modify the parameters accordingly and then run
% this.
% The example data can be obtained from:
