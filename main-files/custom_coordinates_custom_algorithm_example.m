%% MATLAB/Octave code for custom algorithm reconstruction of any ray-tracing compatible data
% This example showcases how to use data that is not in (standard) PET,
% SPECT or CT format. Essentially the only things that are needed are the
% FOV size, the number of voxels in each direction and the source/detector
% coordinates. The example data is a cylindrical PET data but in reality it
% could be anything. This is a simplified example and computes the
% reconstructions by using the built-in class object rather than the
% built-in algorithms. This example can be modified to compute your own
% algorithm.
% Documentation: https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customcoordinates.html
% NOTE: This example has no error checking!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPLEMENTATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Reconstruction implementation used
% 1 = Reconstructions in MATLAB (projector in a MEX-file), uses matrices.
% (Slow and memory intensive)
% 2 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL/CUDA (Recommended)
% (Requires ArrayFire).
% 3 = Multi-GPU/device matrix-free OpenCL (OSEM & MLEM only).
% 4 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenMP (CPU, parallel), standard C++
% 5 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL (parallel)
% See the docs for more information: 
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation.html
options.implementation = 5;

% Applies to implementations 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% OpenCL platform used
% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and
% their respective devices with implementations 3 or 5.
options.platform = 0;

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% OpenCL/CUDA device used
% NOTE: Use ArrayFire_OpenCL_device_info() to determine the device numbers
% with implementation 2.
% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and
% their respective devices with implementations 3 or 5.
% NOTE: The device numbers might be different between implementation 2 and
% implementations 3 and 5
options.use_device = 0;

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% Use 64-bit integer atomic functions
% If true, then 64-bit integer atomic functions (atomic add) will be used
% if they are supported by the selected device.
% Setting this to true will make computations faster on GPUs that support
% the functions, but might make results slightly less reliable due to
% floating point rounding. Recommended for OpenCL GPUs.
options.use_64bit_atomics = true;

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% Use 32-bit integer atomic functions
% If true, then 32-bit integer atomic functions (atomic add) will be used.
% This is even faster than the above 64-bit atomics version, but will also
% have significantly higher reduction in numerical/floating point accuracy.
% This should be about 20-30% faster than the above 64-bit version, but
% might lead to integer overflow if you have a high count measurement
% (thousands of coincidences per sinogram bin). Use this only if speed is
% of utmost importance. 32-bit atomics take precedence over 64-bit ones,
% i.e. if options.use_32bit_atomics = true then the 64-bit version will be 
% always set as false.
options.use_32bit_atomics = false;

% Implementation 2 ONLY
%%% Use CUDA
% Selecting this to true will use CUDA kernels/code instead of OpenCL. This
% only works if the CUDA code was successfully built. This is recommended
% if you have CUDA-capable device.
options.use_CUDA = false;

% Implementation 2 ONLY
%%% Use CPU
% Selecting this to true will use CPU-based code instead of OpenCL or CUDA.
% Not recommended, even OpenCL with CPU should be used before this.
options.use_CPU = false;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROJECTOR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Type of projector to use for the geometric matrix
% 1 = Improved/accelerated Siddon's algorithm
% 2 = Orthogonal distance based ray tracer
% 3 = Volume of intersection based ray tracer
% 4 = Interpolation-based projector
% NOTE: You can mix and match most of the projectors. I.e. 41 will use
% interpolation-based projector for forward projection while improved
% Siddon is used for backprojection.
% See the documentation for more information:
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/selectingprojector.html
options.projector_type = 1;

%%% Use mask
% The mask needs to be a binary mask (uint8 or logical) where 1 means that
% the pixel is included while 0 means it is skipped. Separate masks can be
% used for both forward and backward projection and either one or both can
% be utilized at the same time. E.g. if only backprojection mask is input,
% then only the voxels which have 1 in the mask are reconstructed.
% The mask can be either a 2D image that is applied identically to each slice
% or a 3D mask that is applied as-is
% Forward projection mask
% If nonempty, the mask will be applied. If empty, or completely omitted, no
% mask will be considered.
% options.maskFP = true(options.Ndist,options.Nang);
% Backprojection mask
% If nonempty, the mask will be applied. If empty, or completely omitted, no
% mask will be considered.
% Create a circle that fills the FOV:
% [columnsInImage, rowsInImage] = meshgrid(1:options.Nx, 1:options.Ny);
% centerX = options.Nx/2;
% centerY = options.Ny/2;
% radius = options.Nx/2;
% options.maskBP = uint8((rowsInImage - centerY).^2 ...
%     + (columnsInImage - centerX).^2 <= radius.^2);

%%% Interpolation length (projector type = 4 only)
% This specifies the length after which the interpolation takes place. This
% value will be multiplied by the voxel size which means that 1 is
% the interpolation length corresponding to a single voxel (transaxial)
% length. Larger values lead to faster computation but at the cost of
% accuracy. Recommended values are between [0.5 1].
options.dL = 0.5;

%%% Use point spread function (PSF) blurring
% Applies PSF blurring through convolution to the image space. This is the
% same as multiplying the geometric matrix with an image blurring matrix.
options.use_psf = false;

% FWHM (mm) of the Gaussian used in PSF blurring in all three dimensions (X/Y/Z)
options.FWHM = [2.4 2.4 2.4];

% Orthogonal ray tracer (projector_type = 2 only)
%%% The 2D (XY) width (mm) of the "strip/tube" where the orthogonal distances are
% included. If tube_width_z below is non-zero, then this value is ignored.
options.tube_width_xy = options.cr_p;

% Orthogonal ray tracer (projector_type = 2 only)
%%% The 3D (Z) width (mm) of the "tube" where the orthogonal distances are
% included. If set to 0, then the 2D orthogonal ray tracer is used. If this
% value is non-zero then the above value is IGNORED.
% If you want the projector to be a tube, use this, if you want it to be 
% strip, use the above
% This slows down the reconstruction, but makes it more accurate
options.tube_width_z = options.cr_pz;

% Volume ray tracer (projector_type = 3 only)
%%% Radius of the tube-of-response (cylinder)
% The radius (mm) of the cylinder that approximates the tube-of-response.
options.tube_radius = sqrt(2) * (options.cr_pz / 2);

% Volume ray tracer (projector_type = 3 only)
%%% Relative size of the voxel (sphere)
% In volume ray tracer, the voxels are modeled as spheres. This value
% specifies the relative radius of the sphere such that with 1 the sphere
% is just large enough to encompass an entire cubic voxel, i.e. the
% corners of the cubic voxel intersect with the sphere shell. Larger values
% create larger spheres, while smaller values create smaller spheres.
options.voxel_radius = 1;

% Siddon (projector_type = 1 only)
%%% Number of rays
% Number of rays used per detector if projector_type = 1 (i.e. Improved
% Siddon is used).
% The total number of rays per detector is the multiplication of the two
% below values!
% Number of rays in transaxial direction
options.n_rays_transaxial = 1;
% Number of rays in axial direction
options.n_rays_axial = 1;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RECONSTRUCTION SETTINGS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Number of iterations (all reconstruction methods)
options.Niter = 1;

%%% Save specific intermediate iterations
% You can specify the intermediate iterations you wish to save here. Note
% that this uses zero-based indexing, i.e. 0 is the first iteration (not
% the initial value). By default only the last iteration is saved.
% Note: Subiterations cannot be saved!
options.saveNIter = [];
% Alternatively you can save ALL intermediate iterations by setting the
% below to true and uncommenting it
% Note: Only affects full iterations (epochs)
% options.save_iter = false;

%%% Number of subsets (excluding subset_type = 6)
options.subsets = 8;

%%% Subset type (n = subsets)
% 0 = Measurements are divided into n segments
% 1 = Every nth measurement is taken
% 3 = Measurements are selected randomly
options.subset_type = 3;

%%% Initial value for the reconstruction
options.x0 = ones(options.Nx, options.Ny, options.Nz);

% Set the coordinates for EACH measurement
% The format for options.x variable is
% [sourceX1;sourceY1;sourceZ1;detectorX1;detectorY1;detectorZ1;sourceX2;sourceY2;sourceZ2;detectorX2;...]
% where the number 1 refers to the first measurement, 2 to the second
% measurement, etc. X/Y/Z refers to the X/Y/Z (Cartesian) coordinates. This
% means that there should be SIX (6) coordinates for EACH measurement. Note
% that MATLAB is COLUMN-MAJOR, which means that column values are read
% first. As such, if you wish to use a matrix (which is fine) use
% 6xNumberOfMeasurements matrix. Vector format is recommended though.

% options.CT = true;

%% Class example (OSEM)

% Here is an example of how to obtain the same results as above by using a
% specific MATLAB class. This is a bit more simplified from above and also
% allows more easily to use other properties files (such as
% Inveon_PET_main.m). PSF blurring will be performed automatically if it
% has been selected.
