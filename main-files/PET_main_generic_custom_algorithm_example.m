% Include attenuation correction from images (e.g. CT-images) (for this you
% need attenuation images of each slice correctly rotated and scaled for
% 511 keV) or attenuation sinograms.
% With CT-images you can use attenuationCT_to_511 or
% create_atten_matrix_CT functions to scale the images. 
% If the below attenuation_datafile is empty, UMAPs created with Inveon AW 
% can be used (if the below CT_attenuation is set to true) or, alternatively,

% with the filename saved in the attenuation_datafile field. Alternatively,

% from which the attenuation images will be automatically created and
% saved (filename is saved in the attenuation_datafile field).
% Alternatively, just input the attenuation data into options.vaimennus

% Load your custom detector coordinates and replace the below examples. In
% the example below x contains the detector coordinates for the x-direction
% and so on. For sinogram data, the dimensions need to be the following:
% size(x) = [(number of elements in a SINLGE sinogram) 2]
% size(y) = [(number of elements in a SINLGE sinogram) 2]
% size(z_det) = [(total number of sinograms) 2]
% E.g. each column represents the detector coordinates of one of the
% detectors in a LOR.
% For raw data:
% size(x) = [(detectors per ring) 1]
% size(y) = [(detectors per ring) 1]
% size(z_det) = [(total number of rings) 1]
% For raw data, as long as it is formatted as in OMEGA, you only need each
% detector coordinate once.

%% Class example (OSEM)

% Here is an example of how to obtain the same results as above by using a
% specific MATLAB class. This is a bit more simplified from above and also
% allows more easily to use other properties files (such as
% Inveon_PET_main.m). PSF blurring will be performed automatically if it
% has been selected.

% Construct the forward and backward projections object (you need to rerun
% this if you make any changes to the system):
A = projectorClass(options);
% This is useful if you have normalization coefficient data or delayed
% coincidences data stored in a mat-file (or nrm-file for Inveon data)
A = initCorrections(A);
% You can also manually load corrections:
% A.param.normalization = normalization data
% A.param.vaimennus = attenuation data
% A.param.SinDelayed = randoms and/or scatter data
% This is important if you use subsets!
A.param.normalization = A.param.normalization(A.index);
% The same should be done for randoms and any measurement space-based data
% Load the input data
input = load_data(options);
% or load the data manually:
% load('Inveon_open_PET_data_sinograms_combined_static_128x160x4319_span3_listmode.mat','raw_SinM')
% input = raw_SinM;
% Alternatively, if your measurement data is in other format, you can use
% e.g. loadMeasurementData-function to load the data. The data is in this
% case saved to the variable options.SinM in the case of sinogram data. In
% this case, replace all raw_SinM variables with options.SinM.
% options = loadMeasurementData(options);
