%% MATLAB codes for CBCT reconstruction for the Planmeca data
% This example is for using Planmeca CBCT data. This example is also useful

% Reconstruction-wise everything is same as with the generic CT example.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPLEMENTATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Reconstruction implementation used
% 1 = Reconstructions in MATLAB (projector in a MEX-file), uses matrices.
% (Slow and memory intensive)
% 2 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL/ArrayFire (Recommended)
% (Requires ArrayFire. Compiles with MinGW ONLY when ArrayFire was compiled
% with MinGW as well (cannot use the prebuilt binaries)).
% 3 = Multi-GPU/device matrix-free OpenCL (OSEM & MLEM only).
% 4 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenMP (parallel), standard C++
% 5 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL (parallel)
% See the doc for more information:

% NOTE: Use ArrayFire_OpenCL_device_info() to determine the device numbers
% with implementation 2.
% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and

% NOTE: The device numbers might be different between implementation 2 and
% implementations 3 and 5
options.use_device = 0;

% Implementation 2 ONLY
%%% Use CUDA
% Selecting this to true will use CUDA kernels/code instead of OpenCL. This
% only works if the CUDA code was successfully built.
options.use_CUDA = false;

% Implementation 2 ONLY
%%% Use CPU
% Selecting this to true will use CPU-based code instead of OpenCL or CUDA.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROJECTOR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Type of projector to use for the geometric matrix
% 1 = Improved/accelerated Siddon's algorithm
% 2 = Orthogonal distance based ray tracer
% 3 = Volume of intersection based ray tracer
% 4 = Interpolation-based projector (ray- and voxel-based)
% 5 = Branchless distance-driven projector
% NOTE: You can mix and match most of the projectors. I.e. 41 will use
% interpolation-based projector for forward projection while improved
% Siddon is used for backprojection.
% See the doc for more information:
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/selectingprojector.html
options.projector_type = 4;

%%% Use mask
% The mask needs to be a binary mask (uint8 or logical) where 1 means that
% the pixel is included while 0 means it is skipped. Separate masks can be
% used for both forward and backward projection and either one or both can
% be utilized at the same time. E.g. if only backprojection mask is input,
% then only the voxels which have 1 in the mask are reconstructed.
% Currently the masks need to be a 2D image that is applied identically at
% each slice.
% Forward projection mask
% If nonempty, the mask will be applied. If empty, or completely omitted, no
% mask will be considered.
% options.maskFP = true(options.nRowsD,options.nColsD);

%%% Interpolation length (projector type = 4 only)
% This specifies the length after which the interpolation takes place. This
% value will be multiplied by the voxel size which means that 1 means that
% the interpolation length corresponds to a single voxel (transaxial)
% length. Larger values lead to faster computation but at the cost of
% accuracy. Recommended values are between [0.5 1].

% 3 = Measurements are selected randomly
% 4 = (Sinogram only) Take every nth column in the sinogram
% 5 = (Sinogram only) Take every nth row in the sinogram
% 6 = Sort the LORs according to their angle with positive X-axis, combine
% n_angles together and have 180/n_angles subsets for 2D slices and
% 360/n_angles for 3D, see docs for more information:
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/algorithms.html#type-6
% 7 = Form the subsets by using golden angle sampling
% 8 = Use every nth projection image
% 9 = Randomly select the projection images
% 10 = Use golden angle sampling to select the subsets (not recommended for
% PET)
% 11 = Use prime factor sampling to select the projection images

% Note that if you change any of the model parameters, i.e. image volume
% size, number of projections or use binning, this needs to be recomputed
% or scaled accordingly!
% The computed largest eigenvalue is printed if verbose > 0. This can be 
% used as the below value as long as one is divided by it. For example,

% 1/100 (if you use filtering-based preconditioner this is the "without 
% filtering" value)

% options.delta_PKMA), where i is the iteration number and l the subset
% number. The input number thus has no effect. options.rho_PKMA and
