%% MATLAB/Octave code for reconstruction of any ray-tracing compatible data
% This example showcases how to use data that is not in (standard) PET,
% SPECT or CT format. Essentially the only things that are needed are the
% FOV size, the number of voxels in each direction and the source/detector
% coordinates. The example data is a cylindrical PET data but in reality it
% could be anything. This is a simplified example.
% Documentation: https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/customcoordinates.html
% NOTE: This example has no error checking!

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% IMPLEMENTATIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Reconstruction implementation used
% 1 = Reconstructions in MATLAB (projector in a MEX-file), uses matrices.
% (Slow and memory intensive)
% 2 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL/CUDA (Recommended)
% (Requires ArrayFire).
% 3 = Multi-GPU/device matrix-free OpenCL (OSEM & MLEM only).
% 4 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenMP (CPU, parallel), standard C++
% 5 = Matrix-free reconstruction with OpenCL (parallel)
% See the docs for more information: 
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/implementation.html
options.implementation = 2;

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% OpenCL/CUDA device used
% NOTE: Use ArrayFire_OpenCL_device_info() to determine the device numbers
% with implementation 2.
% NOTE: Use OpenCL_device_info() to determine the platform numbers and
% their respective devices with implementations 3 or 5.
% NOTE: The device numbers might be different between implementation 2 and
% implementations 3 and 5
options.use_device = 0;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PROJECTOR %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Type of projector to use for the geometric matrix
% 1 = Improved/accelerated Siddon's algorithm
% 2 = Orthogonal distance based ray tracer
% 3 = Volume of intersection based ray tracer
% 4 = Interpolation-based projector
% NOTE: You can mix and match most of the projectors. I.e. 41 will use
% interpolation-based projector for forward projection while improved
% Siddon is used for backprojection.
% NOTE 2: The below additional options apply also in hybrid cases as long
% as the other projector is the corresponding projector.
% See the documentation for more information:
% https://omega-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/selectingprojector.html
options.projector_type = 1;

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RECONSTRUCTION SETTINGS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Number of iterations (all reconstruction methods)
options.Niter = 1;

%%% Number of subsets (excluding subset_type = 6 and algorithms that do not
%%% support subsets)
options.subsets = 8;

%%% Subset type (n = subsets)
% 0 = Measurements are divided into n segments
% 1 = Every nth measurement is taken
% 3 = Measurements are selected randomly
options.subset_type = 3;

%%% Initial value for the reconstruction
options.x0 = ones(options.Nx, options.Ny, options.Nz);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% RECONSTRUCTION ALGORITHMS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Reconstruction algorithms to use (choose only one algorithm and
% optionally one prior)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% ML-METHODS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Ordered Subsets Expectation Maximization (OSEM) OR Maximum-Likelihood
%%% Expectation Maximization (MLEM) (if subsets = 1)
% Supported by all implementations
% Note: OSEM, MRAMLA, RAMLA, ROSEM, RBI, COSEM, ACOSEM, ECOSEM are not
% recommended for non-Poisson data
options.OSEM = false;

%%% LSQR
% Supported by implementations 1, 2, 4, and 5
options.LSQR = false;


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MAP-METHODS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Any algorithm selected here will utilize any of the priors selected below
% this. Note that only one algorithm and prior combination is allowed! You
% can also use most of these algorithms without priors (such as PKMA or
% PDHG).
%%% Preconditioned Krasnoselskii-Mann algorithm (PKMA)
% Supported by implementations 1, 2, 4, and 5
options.PKMA = false;

%%% Primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG)
% Supported by implementations 1, 2, 4, and 5
options.PDHG = true;

% You can input other reconstruction parameters and priors as in the other
% examples

% Input the measurement data
load Cylindrical_PET_example_cylpet_example_new_sinograms_combined_static_200x168x703_span3.mat
options.SinM = raw_SinM;

% Set the coordinates for EACH measurement
% The format for options.x variable is
% [sourceX1;sourceY1;sourceZ1;detectorX1;detectorY1;detectorZ1;sourceX2;sourceY2;sourceZ2;detectorX2;...]
% where the number 1 refers to the first measurement, 2 to the second
% measurement, etc. X/Y/Z refers to the X/Y/Z (Cartesian) coordinates. This
% means that there should be SIX (6) coordinates for EACH measurement. Note
% that MATLAB is COLUMN-MAJOR, which means that column values are read
% first. As such, if you wish to use a matrix (which is fine) use
% 6xNumberOfMeasurements matrix. Vector format is recommended though.
