% Firstly this specifies the FWHM of TOF data used for file naming and

% differences. If you are using GATE data and have set a custom temporal
% blurring in GATE then you should set to this zero if you wish to use the
% same temporal resolution. If no custom temporal blurring was applied then
% use this value to control the accuracy of the TOF data. For example if

% Applies to implementations 2, 3 and 5 ONLY
%%% Use 32-bit integer atomic functions
% If true, then 32-bit integer atomic functions (atomic add) will be used
